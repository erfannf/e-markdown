## üåü Introduction

Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are essential for visualizing and documenting industrial processes across chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and other process industries. This specification introduces a **markdown-based syntax** for creating standardized PFDs that can be:
- **Human-readable**: Easily understood and edited by engineers without specialized software.
- **Machine-interpretable**: Parsable by Large Language Models (LLMs), visualization tools, and simulation software.
- **Scalable**: Capable of representing both simple unit operations and complex integrated processes.
- **Version-controllable**: Compatible with standard version control systems like Git.

The syntax is aligned with industry standards including **ISO 10628** (flow diagrams for process plants), **ANSI/ISA-5.1** (instrumentation symbols and identification), and **DIN 28004** (flow sheet symbols), ensuring compatibility with established engineering practices.

---

## üìñ Syntax Overview

The PFD markdown syntax follows a hierarchical structure with clearly defined sections, each representing a fundamental component of the process diagram:

- **Limits**: Battery limits defining incoming and outgoing points where streams enter or exit the current PFD sheet, including source/destination references and descriptions
- **Equipment**: Process vessels, reactors, columns, heat exchangers, pumps, and other physical apparatus.
- **Streams**: Material flows with associated properties (flow rate, temperature, pressure, composition).
- **Instruments**: Measurement devices, sensors, transmitters, and analytical equipment.
- **Valves**: Flow control, pressure regulation, and isolation devices.
- **Data Connections**: Signal pathways between instruments, controllers, and final control elements.

Each component is defined using a standardized **key-value pair** structure within square brackets, with nested attributes denoted by indentation or sub-lists. This structure ensures both human readability and machine parseability.

## üß© Core Components

### üöß Limits
Limits represent the battery boundaries of the process flow diagram, defining where streams enter or exit the current PFD sheet. They are essential for connecting multiple PFDs together in a larger process system and are defined using the syntax `[Incoming: <ID>]` or `[Outgoing: <ID>]`.

#### Formal Syntax:
```markdown
## Limits
### Incoming Points
- [Incoming: <ID>, Unit=<UnitNumber>, PFD=<PFDNumber>, Location=<GridCoordinate>]
  - Stream: [Stream: <ID>, <Properties>]
  - Connects To: [<DestinationType>: <DestinationID>, <EquipmentType>: <EquipmentID>]
  - Description: "<Text describing the source of this stream>"

### Outgoing Points
- [Outgoing: <ID>, Unit=<UnitNumber>, PFD=<PFDNumber>, Location=<GridCoordinate>]
  - Stream: [Stream: <ID>, <Properties>]
  - Connects From: [<SourceType>: <SourceID>, <EquipmentType>: <EquipmentID>]
  - Description: "<Text describing the destination of this stream>"
```

#### Example:
```markdown
## Limits
### Incoming Points
- [Incoming: IN-501, Unit=501, PFD=501, Location=G1, Description="Feed from Storage Area"]
  - Stream: [Stream: 1, Flow=100 m¬≥/h, T=50¬∞C, P=1 bar, Composition="H2O=90%, NaCl=10%"]
  - Connects To: [Nozzle: N1, Distillation Tower: T-101]

### Outgoing Points
- [Outgoing: OUT-503, Unit=503, PFD=503, Location=G9, Description="Product to Packaging"]
  - Stream: [Stream: 7, Flow=40 m¬≥/h, T=35¬∞C, P=1.5 bar, Composition="H2O=95%, NaCl=5%"]
  - Connects From: [Nozzle: N4, Distillation Tower: T-101]
```

- [Nozzle: <ID>, Location=<Position>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>, Size=<Value>, Service="<Description>"]
- [Nozzle: <ID>, Location=<Position>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>, Size=<Value>, Service="<Description>"]
...
```

#### Example:
```markdown
[Equipment: Distillation Tower, T-101, Height=30m, Diameter=2m, Material="316L SS", Design_Pressure=10 bar, Location=C5]
- [Nozzle: N1, Location=Top, Grid=C5-T, Size=6", Service="Feed Inlet"]
- [Nozzle: N2, Location=Middle, Grid=C5-M, Size=4", Service="Side Draw"]

### üåä Streams
Streams represent material flows between equipment and are defined using the syntax `[Stream: <ID>, <Properties>]`. Stream definitions include physical properties, flow characteristics, and routing information.

#### Formal Syntax:
```markdown
[Stream: <ID>, Flow=<Value> <Unit>, T=<Value> <Unit>, P=<Value> <Unit>, Phase="<Phase>", Composition="<Components>", Path=<StartGrid> -> <EndGrid>]
- From: [<SourceType>: <SourceID>]
- To: [<DestinationType>: <DestinationID>]
- Tap: [<TapID>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>]
  - [<ComponentType>: <ComponentID>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>]
```

#### Example:
```markdown
[Stream: 1, Flow=100 m¬≥/h, T=50¬∞C, P=1 bar, Phase="Liquid", Composition="H2O=90%, NaCl=10%", Path=G1 -> C5-T]
- From: [Incoming: IN-501]
- To: [Nozzle: N1, Distillation Tower: T-101]
- Tap: [TP1, Grid=C5-T]
  - [Valve: Control Valve, CV-101, Grid=C5-T]
```

---

### üéõÔ∏è Instruments
Instruments represent measurement, control, and analytical devices within the process system and are defined using the syntax `[Instrument: <Type>, <ID>, <Attributes>]`. Instrument definitions include measurement specifications, signal types, and placement information.

#### Formal Syntax:
```markdown
[Instrument: <Type>, <ID>, Range=<Min>-<Max> <Unit>, Unit=<Unit>, Accuracy=<Value>, Response_Time=<Value>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>]
- Placement: [<PlacementType>: <PlacementID>, <EquipmentType>: <EquipmentID>]
- Signal: [<SignalType>, <Protocol>]
```

- Placement: [Nozzle: N1, Distillation Tower: T-101]
- Signal: [4-20mA, HART Protocol]
```

---

### üö™ Valves
Valves represent flow control, isolation, and pressure regulation devices within the process system and are defined using the syntax `[Valve: <Type>, <ID>, <Attributes>]`. Valve definitions include physical specifications, materials of construction, and operational parameters.

#### Formal Syntax:

- Connection: [Stream: 1, Tap: TP1]
- Actuator: [Pneumatic, ACT-101, Air_Supply=3-15 psi]
```

---

### üîó Data Connections
Data connections represent signal pathways between instruments, controllers, and final control elements in control loops and are defined using the `-.->` syntax. These connections illustrate the flow of information and control signals throughout the process system.

#### Formal Syntax:
```markdown
[<SourceType>: <SourceID>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>] -.-> [<DestinationType>: <DestinationID>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>]
- Signal_Type: [<Type>, <Protocol>]
- Priority: [<Level>]
```

#### Example:
```markdown
[Instrument: Flow Meter, FT-101, Grid=C5-T] -.-> [Controller: FC-101, Grid=C5-T]
- Signal_Type: [Digital, Foundation Fieldbus]
- Priority: [High]

[Controller: FC-101, Grid=C5-T] -.-> [Valve: Control Valve, CV-101, Grid=C5-T]
- Signal_Type: [4-20mA, HART]
- Priority: [High]
```

#### Control Loop Example:
```markdown
# Temperature Control Loop for Distillation Column
[Instrument: Temperature Sensor, TT-101, Grid=C5-T] -.-> [Controller: TC-101, Grid=C5-T]
[Controller: TC-101, Grid=C5-T] -.-> [Valve: Control Valve, CV-101, Grid=C5-T]
```

---

### üîÄ Stream Intersections
Stream intersections represent points where multiple streams merge together or a single stream splits into multiple streams. These are critical elements in process flow diagrams and are defined using the `[Intersection: <ID>, <Attributes>]` syntax.

#### Formal Syntax:
```markdown
[Intersection: <ID>, Grid=<GridCoordinate>, Type="<MergeOrSplit>"]
- Incoming: [Stream: <ID1>] (for merge: multiple streams, for split: single stream)
- Outgoing: [Stream: <ID2>, Stream: <ID3>, ...] (for merge: single stream, for split: multiple streams)
```

#### Merge Example:
```markdown
# Two streams merging into one
[Intersection: X-1, Grid=E7, Type="Merge"]
- Incoming: [Stream: 2, Stream: 3]
- Outgoing: [Stream: 4]
```

#### Split Example:
```markdown
# One stream splitting into two
[Intersection: X-2, Grid=C5, Type="Split"]
- Incoming: [Stream: 5]
- Outgoing: [Stream: 6, Stream: 7]
```

#### Complex Example:
```markdown
# Multiple stream intersection with flow distribution
[Intersection: X-3, Grid=G5, Type="Distribution"]
- Incoming: [Stream: 8, Stream: 9]
- Outgoing: [Stream: 10, Stream: 11, Stream: 12]
- Distribution: [Stream: 8 -> Stream: 10 (70%), Stream: 11 (30%)]
- Distribution: [Stream: 9 -> Stream: 12 (100%)]
```

Stream intersections can be represented visually using diamond symbols (‚óá) on the diagram, with connecting lines showing the flow direction between incoming and outgoing streams.

## üó∫Ô∏è Grid System

A **virtual grid system** is used to specify the location of items on the PFD. The grid uses letters (columns) and numbers (rows), e.g., `G1` (Column G, Row 1). Nozzles on equipment are assigned specific grid locations, e.g., `C5-T` (Top nozzle at Column C, Row 5).

#### Example:
```markdown
[Equipment: Distillation Tower, T-101, Location=C5]
- [Nozzle: N1, Location=Top, Grid=C5-T]
- [Nozzle: N2, Location=Middle, Grid=C5-M]
- [Nozzle: N3, Location=Bottom, Grid=C5-B]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices
1. **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow a consistent naming convention for IDs (e.g., `T-101`, `P-101`).
2. **Leverage the Grid System**: Use grid coordinates to precisely locate items.
3. **Consolidate Instruments**: Group all instruments in a dedicated section for readability.
4. **Validate with LLMs**: Test the markdown with LLMs to ensure interpretability.
