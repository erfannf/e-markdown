# e-markdown (Engineering Markdown)

Welcome to the **Engineering Markdown (e-markdown)** repository! This project aims to establish standardized markdown-based syntaxes for various engineering documents, making them both human-readable and machine-interpretable.

> **Note:** This is an emerging collection of specifications, designed to bring consistency and interoperability to engineering documentation across disciplines.

## üìå Overview

Engineering documentation has traditionally relied on specialized software tools, creating barriers to collaboration and integration. The e-markdown project addresses this by developing open, text-based specifications that can be:

- **Version controlled** using standard tools like Git
- **Edited** with any text editor
- **Parsed** by machines for visualization and analysis
- **Shared** across teams without proprietary software requirements
- **Integrated** with modern AI and automation tools

## üìö Specifications

The e-markdown project currently includes the following specifications:

### [PFD Markdown](pfd-markdown/) - Process Flow Diagrams
A markdown syntax for creating Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) used in chemical, petrochemical, and process industries. The specification defines how to represent equipment, streams, instruments, and their relationships.

**Status:** Rev.0 - Initial specification available

### [P&ID Markdown](pid-markdown/) - Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams
An extension of PFD Markdown that adds detailed piping specifications, comprehensive instrumentation details, and control system integration for creating Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).

**Status:** Planned - Development roadmap available

### Future Specifications

We plan to develop additional specifications for:

- **Electrical Diagrams** - Single-line and schematic representations
- **Civil/Structural Drawings** - Foundation and structural element specifications
- **Material Specifications** - Standardized material property documentation
- **Test Procedures** - Structured test methodology documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

Each specification in the e-markdown family includes:

1. **Formal syntax definitions** - Clear rules for representing engineering elements
2. **Examples** - Practical demonstrations of the syntax in use
3. **Best practices** - Guidelines for effective implementation
4. **Visualization guidance** - Recommendations for rendering the markdown as diagrams

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the engineering community! To contribute:

1. **Provide feedback** on existing specifications
2. **Suggest new specifications** for other engineering document types
3. **Develop tools** that implement these specifications
4. **Share examples** of the specifications in use

Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## üìú License

All specifications in the e-markdown project are licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. This permissive license allows you to:

- Freely use, modify, distribute, and sell implementations of these specifications
- Include the specifications in proprietary products
- Make changes without being required to release those changes
