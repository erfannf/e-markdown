# P&ID Markdown Specification

This repository will contain the **P&ID Markdown Specification**, a markdown-based syntax for creating **Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)** that are both human-readable and machine-interpretable.

> **Note:** This specification is currently under development. The full implementation will follow the template established by the [PFD Markdown Specification](https://github.com/erfannf/e-markdown/pfd-markdown).

## Coming Soon

The P&ID Markdown Specification will extend the concepts from the PFD Markdown Specification to include:

- Detailed piping specifications
- Comprehensive instrumentation details
- Control system integration
- Safety systems representation
- Equipment connections and utilities
- Line sizing and specifications
- Valve types and details

## Development Roadmap

1. **Q1 2025**: Initial specification draft
2. **Q2 2025**: Community feedback and revision
3. **Q3 2025**: First stable release

## Relationship to PFD Markdown

While Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) show the general flow of plant processes and the relationship between major equipment, P&IDs (Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams) provide a more detailed view including:

- All piping including physical line sizes and identification
- All valves and their identifications
- Process control instrumentation and designation
- Safety and regulatory modifications

The P&ID Markdown Specification will maintain compatibility with the PFD Markdown Specification while extending it to accommodate these additional details.

## Contributing

We welcome input on the development of this specification. Please open an issue to suggest features or considerations for the upcoming specification.

## License

This project will be licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**, consistent with the PFD Markdown Specification.
